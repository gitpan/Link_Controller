	UNTESTED OPTIONS

Many different options have not yet been tested.  Certainly there is
no way that every combination of options have been tested.
Contributions to the test suite are very much appreciated.  

Particular problems in the current version are likely to be that
collection of links from web pages has not been tested.  This software
is still under development and should be considered as such.

	FRAGMENTS

It seems that fragments often contain spaces.  In this case they are
left out of the database.  Actually, the fragment should be recorded
separately within the link and then it should be part of resource
_content_ verification.  For properly defined URL schemes, the
resource its self will always be retrieved / activated in one go..

	LOSSES FROM DATABASE

There were some losses from the database.  These should now be fixed.
Of course it's still possible to lose information if a crash occurs
during a database write.  Keep backups as usual.

	LOCATION OF PERL

I make the assumption that the perl that is first in your path is the
one you want to use.  The choice of perl should be propagated through to
the Progcopy.PL script and tests from the Makefile.PL.

	SUNOS COMMAND START UP

On SunOS 4, the -w flags in the first line of all the programs end up
split across the maximum length of a command for me.  This leads to
the error

  Unrecognized switch: - .

Strangely this only happens with some of the programs The only
solution is to fix the programs by hand.  Just add ten or so spaces
after between perl and the option.  Or better yet upgrade to a more
modern operating system.

If anyone knows the general rule about which bit of the first line is
used on what operating system, I can try to ensure that this doesn't
get installed broken.
