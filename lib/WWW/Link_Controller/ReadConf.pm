=head1 NAME

WWW::Link_Controller::ReadConf - Read LinkController configuration files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use WWW::Link_Controller::ReadConf;
   print $::links;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This moduleis a way of reading the config file into each of the
LinkController programs.  All it does is require a file.

    /etc/link-control.pl

followed by

    $ENV{"HOME"} . "/.link-control.pl"

but that works for now.

In order to avoid reading the home directory, unset the $ENV{"HOME"}
variable.

=head1 VARIABLES

 $user_address - email address of the user - for use when testing
    links to allow contact from web adminstrators if anything goes
    wrong.  This must be set to your email address

 $links - filname of database database containing information about the
    status of each individual link

 $schedule - filename of database of times when links should be tested.

 $page_index - filename of index in which we can look up a page and
    find out which links it has

 $link_index - filename of index in whcih we can look up a link and see
    which pages it occurs on

 $fixlink_cgi - url which leads to the active cgi script for fixing
    links.

 $max_link_age - age after which we delete links from the database

=head1 BUGS

Should allow to override the files.
