                                 Installation
                                       
   LinkController's installation system is based on that of a normal Perl
   module.
   
   The module is normally distributed along with several other modules.
   Please install these before LinkController.
   
   The portability of LinkController to systems other than RedHat Linux
   is likely to be a problem. The scale of that problem will depend on
   how far from RedHat Linux your system is.

                             installation from rpm
                                       
   The easiest way to install link controller is to have the distribution
   in RPM format. In this case, simply install each of the RPMs with
   @command{rpm -i}. Trying to install just LinkController will give a
   list of the required rpm packages.

                         installation from perl module
                                       
   If your system doesn't run rpm then there isn't yet a pre-packaged
   version (hopefully someone will do a port to Debian's packaging
   system).

installation pre-requisites

   Before installing LinkController, you must install perl and a series
   of related perl modules. The full list is given in
   lib/Bundle/LinkController.pm.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
detailed steps for install

   First you must install perl. Then run the following commands.
   
       perl Makefile.pl;
       make;
       make test;
       make install;

   All of the tests should pass. Do make sure that you run them so that
   you know that everything is working properly.
   
   Please note that you must run make before you run make test because of
   the configuration of the installation system.

Choosing a Platform

   Installing this software can be easy or difficult depending on what
   operating system platform you are running on.. In approximate order
   from easiest to most difficult (this is my guess)
     * RedHat Linux equal or better than 6.0 (see
       [7]http://www.redhat.com/)
     * other Linux (see [8]http://www.linux.org/ for example)
     * SUNOS with perl 5.003 or better already
     * other UNIX perl 5.003 or better already
     * UNIX without perl
     * WinNT
     * Macintosh
     * Other Windows
       
   With a previous version I had tried the top four. Probably to get the
   system running on SunOS will require manually setting up the system
   since the programs for doing the default installation (in the
   @file{default-install}) becuase that uses various GNU administration
   programs which SunOS probably doesn't emulate accurately.
   
   You will probably find it easier to just install Linux that to get
   this running on Windows. If you do want to get it running on other
   operating systems and provide clean patches, then I will be supportive
   and helpful, but please note that I think most of the portability
   problems will be with the underlying perl modules and CDB related
   stuff.
