This is an attempt at an example infostructure designed to let you
play around with LinkController before you actually start checking
your own links.

It's not currently up to date.  

Install the commands then copy example.link-control to .link-control
in your home directory and edit it to give the directory.  Then try
some things like the following

	link-report -r -I

	check-page public_html/uk-climate-and-weather.html

	fix-link http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~mikedlr/climbing/ \
		 http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/climb/
	
you can see what changes have been made by looking at the new files
.orig and comparing them with the old versions.
