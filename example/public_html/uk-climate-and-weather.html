<H1>Climate and weather</H1>

<P>Unfortunately, the maps we are using in this section are in
farenheight.  For this reason, you might want to have a temperature
conversion scale <A HREF="farenheight-to-celsius.ps">picture</A> or 
<A HREF="farenheight-to-celsius.html">text</A>.  If you are using
Netscape to read this, then you might have to press reload to see some
of the text.  There seems to be a bug in that browser (well actually
many.. moan moan moan..).  Hopefully fixed in a later version.  Please
tell me if you find it completely unreadable, and I will write a new
Netscape aware version of the page.  Other people should be okay (I've
checked with three other browsers).

<P>The UK is almost entirely surrounded by the sea, and it is the state
of the sea which has probably the most influence on the weather;
however, to the South and East, the continental land mass of Europe is
very close across a relatively small sea, so it can directly control
the United Kingdom's weather in certain circumstances.

<P clear="40 en">Scotland's climate then?  Temperate western
fringe****.  What this means is a little of everything through the
whole year.  <EM>Average</EM> temperatures never actually go below
freezing, or zero Celsius (32 Farenheight) and never go above room
temperature or 20 Celsius.  Rainfall happens all year round, with most
in the winter (an somewhat unusual feature, I understand from my
school geography).

<P>In the winter, the most important source of heat in the UK is the
sea.  The gulf stream, which originates in the Gulf of Mexico comes
almost straight to the UK and totally controls the winter climate.  To
give some idea of the strength of the effect, other places in the same
latitude range include Moscow, Edmonton (somewhat north of Calgary)
and the Southernmost tip of Greenland (also Gulf Stream heated).  For
those of an upside down map persuasion, this is equivalent to the
Southernmost tip of South America or Macquarie, far South of New
Zealand.  Within the country the parts furthest from the effect of the
Gulf Stream become the coldest, which means the East (see the January
temperature map)

<P>What all of these averages hide is that variations in the direction
of the wind can cause great variations in temperature.  In particular,
if winds come from Northern continental Europe or the Arctic, very
cold weather can prevail (here, very cold means as much as -15
degrees.  Well, we call it very cold..).  Much much more detail,
especially on the climbing aspects of winter weather, can be found on
this in books such as <em>Scotland's Winter Mountains</em> by Martin
Moran.

<P>In summer, the major heat source is the sun.  The seas surrounding
the UK moderate the temperatures.  This leads to a fairly
straightforward pattern of more heat in the South than the North and
cooler areas by the Sea than in the Centre of the UK.  Remembering
that the furthest that you can get from the sea in the UK is 40 miles,
this effect is relatively weak.  Again the direction of the wind is
very important in controlling the weather.

<P><IMG SRC="h-uk-rain.jpg" ALT="[UK rainfall map]" align=center>

<P>Rainfall in the UK is a clearer story.  Rain falls in the West;
rain falls in Scotland; rain falls on the Mountains; rain falls on
me... The warm water over the Gulf Stream gives up a lot of water
vapour.  Winds coming from that direction pass over the mountains of
the West of Scotland, the Lake District or Wales.  When they do this,
they lose their water content as they go.  Winds coming from other
directions tend to cause much less rain.  The South East of England is
a surprisingly dry place.  Rainfall is continuously available through
the year, but some times are obviously worse than others.  Have a look
at at this comparison <EM>provided by

<H2>Choosing When to Visit the UK</H2>

<H3>Rock Climbing</H3>

<P>As you can see from the graph above, if you want to visit Scotland,
April Through to June are the months to do it.  Unfortunately, of
course, most of the rest of Europe gets holidays in July.  A quick
look at the rainfall charts will convince you that this isn't always
the best time to come for Rock climbing (though if it is a hot summer
then it will be the hottest time).  Many cliffs dry fast however, and
it is traditional to climb many climbs in the rain.  When I hear that
British people are traditionalist, I sometimes doubt my nationality...
Further South it's okay to come later, but still September is a truly
rainy month.

<H3>Ice Climbing</H3>

<P>Choosing when to go ice climbing is an art mainly involving the use
of a crystal ball, and many many druidic incantations.  Ice in
Scotland forms every Monday and disappears in time for the weekend.
The Cullin ridge is a target for which you aim, and only arrive in
perfect conditions when the great Celtic kings of old wander among
the mountains.. or something.  Ben Nevis mostly has something formed,
depending on how crazy you are.  When it's cold, but there is no ice
there is always turf climbing.  I don't know how well known this is in
other places, but good frozen turf has the same legendary position in
Scottish climbing as perfect Nev****(accents)e seems to have in the
rest of the world.

<P>Outside Scotland, there are ice routes in Wales, the Lake District
and probably London.  I don't think these are worth deliberately
travelling to.  They seem to form for only a few days a year, but of
course, if you're in the area (almost the whole of England counts
here), then try it.  My first ice climb was in the Lake District and
was a great mixture of consolidated snow, reasonable ice, rock and
turf.  Since then, I have done one gully route in the Lakes ever.  I
have been down there fairly regularly, and tend to take ice gear just
in case.
