<H1>Weather and Climate Information</H1>

<P>Scottish weather is totally unpredictable.  Because we are close to
the sea, a large continent, the arctic and the warm air from the gulf
stream, there are many conflicting influences.  Weather patterns
change immensely in time periods of a few hours.  It can also be very
dangerous.  We have often have a combination of strong winds with rain
show and hail.  This means that temperatures which would be completely
unthreatening in other conditions lead to hypothermia.  Many people
have come here equipped for small hills and easy conditions (4000 feet
does not sound impressive to people used to 4000 meters) and got into
serious problems.  End of dire warnings.<P>

<P>Understanding the climate in Scotland is crucial to enjoying visits to
the hills.  First read a <A HREF="uk-climate-and-weather.html">general
introduction</A>.  Then try to find out more details on weather
today..  Finally, if the are relevant to you, try out one of the
services providing information to climbers.

Some of these seem somewhat out of date...  some of them anyway..  I'll

<P>See also our <A HREF="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~mikedlr/climbing/">page 
on conditions generally</A> (should include such things as midges
which we can happily avoid mentioning here).

<P><em>Just remember that the weather can change at a moments notice, you would 
also be well advised to 'get the telly on' and see what John Kettely 
or the like have to say on the matter.</em><BR>
