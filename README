                        README for LinkController 0.005

   LinkController is a package which is designed to allow the checking of
   links  in  sophisticated  ways.  If  you  have  ever noticed that link
   checkers  spend more time sending you to sites which just happen to be
   down  for  the  day  due  to maintainance problems than to real broken
   links, this should be for you.

   LinkController  normally  works  by  checking  all  of your links to a
   database  during low usage times on your network. After a few days, it
   will  have  built up a list of those links which are really broken and
   you can then examine them and do what repairs and changes are needed.

   Once  you have the database built, you can selectively report problems
   with  your  links  across  all  of  your  pages and repair broken ones
   rapidly,  either  using LinkControllers direct substitution system, or
   by  directly opening the page up in your favorite editor (direct emacs
   support is provided).

   LinkController  includes  a  system for rapidly changing links through
   your html pages, for example as you write new ones. To do this it uses
   the database that it has already built up.

   Link controller is based over the World Wide Web capabilities provided
   by  LibWWW-Perl  and  as  such should be easy to modify and extend. It
   should also be reliable and safe to use.

   Link  Controller  is available under the GNU Public License to protect
   your rights as a user of the software.
     * Link checking

     * network efficient
     * works in network low usage time
     * obeys robot exclusion rules

   That  the source code is under the GPL means that your right to modify
   it  is  protected  and  that you can be sure that if you come across a
   version of this software in use somewhere, and have to do maintainance
   on  it,  you  will at least have access to the source code. That means
   that even if you can't fix it yourself, you can hire someone who can.
