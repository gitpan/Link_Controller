This is a mode which will make link-controller very easy to use from
within emacs.  What it does is opens up a dired window on the output
from check-all.  

typically to use it you'll do something like this

	M-x load-file [type the filename] <ret>
	M-x link-report-dired --redirect <ret>  ;you can use other arguments

The other arguments which make it generate the correct format are
supplied automatically.

You can then move about the list of broken links and under each one,
you can open any of the files the link happens in simply by pressing
'f' or with the second mouse button if you are using a mouse.  

Once you have loaded the file with the broken links, you might want to
fix all of the broken links in that file.  Try using

	M-x compile check-page [filename]

You can then move through the list of suspicious links with 

	M-`

(that's a real back quote, not an apostrophe) or by using mouse
buttons etc.  Fix them as you go along.

To be honest, I have very little clue how I did this.  I took the
find-dired file and cut out those bits too strongly related to find.
Then I stuck back in the bits that it seemed to need to work.
Finally, for very little apparent reason, it worked.

Improvements possible. (emacs hackers go for it)

	The broken link appears above the list of files.  We should
	open on the first occurence of that link (or at least do it
	optionally) 

	The directory logic probably isn't.  Make it.

	We should have code to signal to the link system when an
	edited file is changed, so it can update information from that
	file.
