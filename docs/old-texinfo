There's another way to do this.  We can relate our list of broken links
to an infostructure.  In your case that's probably just your HTML
pages.  And since the software can only handle one infostructure at
present there's no complexity.

@example
link-report --infostructure
@end example

or even

@example
link-report -I
@end example

@example
broken:-       http://www.ippt.gov.pl/smarr.hdf
broken:-       http://www.ippt.gov.pl/~Perzyna
broken:-       http://www.ippt.gov.pl/~bradzisz

ments/usage.ps
broken:-       http://www.ippt.gov.pl/ippt/spokomm/spokomm.html
...etc...
@end example




@cindex URLs, mailto
@cindex mailto URLs
@cindex URLs, news
@cindex news URLs
At the present time @samp{mailto:} and @samp{news:} links are always
reported broken even when they aren't.  You might want to use something
like.

@example
link-report -e'^mailto' -e'^news' ...normal arguments...
@end example

in order to avoid getting the spurious reports about them.
