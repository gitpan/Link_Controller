README for LinkController docs directory

Various files in this directory have different levels of up to
dateness.  The manual (in the HTML directory in HTML format and in
info format in the file link-controller.info) is in a reasonably good
state.

You may need to have an recent version of texinfo to build it into
formats not included.

At least the texinfo.tex included here should let you generate latex and
other formats derived from it.

Some of the files here are random disassociated thoughts.  They can be
easily ignored, but if you have any useful comments to them then feel
free to email me.
