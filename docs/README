Various files in this directory have different levels of up to
dateness.  The manual (in the HTML directory in HTML format and in
info format in the file link-controller.info) is in a reasonably good
state.

Some of the files here are random disassociated thoughts.  They can be
easily ignored, but if you have any useful comments to them then feel
free to email me.
